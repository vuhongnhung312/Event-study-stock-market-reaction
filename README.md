Event-study-stock-market-reaction
This project aims to study whether the stock market considers insider trading plan disclosure worthy of informational content
Focus: market reaction on ex-ante trading announcements
The methodology is adopted from Campbell(1997), the crossectional regression method, accompanied by Wilcoxon test for robustness
Event study catering for each announcement is also provided, yet I do not use the result for analysis
