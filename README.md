# Event-study-stock-market-reaction

<sub>This project aims to study whether the stock market considers insider trading plan disclosure worthy of informational content.
The methodology is adopted from Campbell(1997), the crossectional regression method, accompanied by Wilcoxon test for robustness.
Event study catering for each announcement is also provided, yet I do not use the result for analysis</sub>
